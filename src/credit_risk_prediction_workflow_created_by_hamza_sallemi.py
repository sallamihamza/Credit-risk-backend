# 💻 ***Code Explanation: Credit Risk Prediction Workflow***
This code block performs several key steps in a typical machine learning pipeline used for credit risk prediction, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the best model. It is particularly relevant in domains like finance and credit scoring, aligning well with ***Hamza Sallemi***’s interests in data science and fintech.

"""## 📚 Why These Libraries?

This notebook uses a set of core libraries to build a complete machine learning pipeline for credit risk prediction:

- **pandas & numpy**: For data loading, analysis, and numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)**:
  - `train_test_split`, `GridSearchCV`: Data splitting and hyperparameter tuning.
  - `StandardScaler`, `OneHotEncoder`: Preprocessing for numerical and categorical features.
  - `ColumnTransformer`, `Pipeline`: Modular and efficient data handling.
  - `LogisticRegression`, `RandomForestClassifier`: Widely used classifiers in finance.
  - `metrics`: For evaluating model accuracy, precision, recall, AUC, and more.
- **xgboost**: High-performance gradient boosting framework, often used in credit scoring.
- **joblib**: Saves the full pipeline (model + preprocessing) for reuse in production.

This setup ensures a robust, interpretable, and scalable model development process aligned with real-world financial applications.

"""### 🧹 4. Setting up Preprocessing Pipelines

This section sets up the **data preprocessing steps** using `sklearn` Pipelines and `ColumnTransformer`. These steps ensure that numerical and categorical data are appropriately transformed before being passed to the machine learning models.

---

#### 🔢 `numerical_transformer`
A pipeline specifically for **numerical features**:
- Uses `StandardScaler()` to standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
- This preprocessing is essential for algorithms like logistic regression or XGBoost that are sensitive to feature scaling.

```python
numerical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())

In this section, we split our dataset into training and testing subsets and prepare the preprocessing pipeline for future use.

#### 🧪 `train_test_split`
We use `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` to split the data:
- `test_size=0.2`: Reserves 20% of the data for testing.
- `random_state=42`: Ensures reproducibility of the split.
- `stratify=y`: Maintains the same proportion of target classes (`0` for no risk, `1` for high risk) in both the training and testing sets. This is crucial for classification tasks, especially with **imbalanced datasets**.

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(

"""### 🔄 7. Model Training and Evaluation Loop

This is the core part of the machine learning pipeline where each model in the `models` dictionary is trained and evaluated.

---

#### Step-by-step Process:

1. **Iterate over each model:**
   For every model in the dictionary, the code creates a combined pipeline that includes:
   - The previously defined `preprocessor` (handling scaling and encoding).
   - The current classification model.

2. **Train the pipeline:**
   The combined pipeline is trained on the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`). This ensures the preprocessing is applied consistently during training.

3. **Make predictions:**
   - Predict the class labels for the test set (`X_test`) using `.predict()`.
   - Predict the probabilities for the positive class (risk = 1) using `.predict_proba()[:, 1]`.

4. **Calculate evaluation metrics:**
   Using the true labels and predictions, calculate:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - ROC AUC score
   - Detailed classification report
   - Confusion matrix

5. **Store and print the results:**
   Save all metrics in the `results` dictionary and print a summary to the console for each model.

6. **Track the best model:**
   If the current model’s ROC AUC score is higher than the previous best, update the tracking variables:
   - `best_roc_auc`
   - `best_model_name`
   - `best_trained_model` (store the entire pipeline)

7. **Handle errors:**
   Use a `try...except` block to catch and handle any exceptions during training or evaluation, allowing the loop to continue running through all models even if one fails.

After training and evaluating all models, this section:

- Checks if a `best_trained_model` was found.
- If yes, saves the entire pipeline (including preprocessing and classifier) to `best_credit_risk_model.pkl` using `joblib`.
- Saves the original feature names before preprocessing to `original_feature_names.csv`, which helps with model interpretation later (e.g., using SHAP).
- Prints confirmation messages about the saved model and feature names.
- If no model was successfully trained, prints a message to indicate that.
- Finally, confirms that the modeling and evaluation process is complete.

This ensures you have the best performing model ready for deployment or further analysis, and a record of the original input features.
